    "## Bedrock model integration with Langchain Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain applications demand an adaptable sequence of calls to language models and various utilities depending on user input. The Agent interface enables such flexibility for these applications. An agent has availability to a range of resources and selects which ones to utilize based on the user input. Agents are capable of using multiple tools and utilizing the output of one tool as the input for the next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary categories of agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action agents: At each interval, determine the subsequent action utilizing the outputs of all previous actions. \n",
    "- Plan-and-execute agents: Determine the complete order of actions initially, then implement them all without updating the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the use `Zero-shot ReAct` and uses the [`ReAct`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf) framework to select the appropriate tool based exclusively on the tool's description. It requires you provide the description of each tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* **Install Dependencies**: Be sure to run the [setup notebook](../00_Intro/bedrock_boto3_setup.ipynb) and install the dependencies.\n",
    "* **IAM Permissions**: The IAM profile running this notebook will need ReadOnly access to EC2. The best way to do this is attach the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy to the IAM role this notebook is running under.\n",
    "* **Create an EC2 instance** with a tag name of 'delete' and a value of 'this instance should be stopped'. Once the instance has been started, set the state to stopped."
